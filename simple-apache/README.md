Simple Apache Vagrant Configuration
===================================

Here you will find a Vagrant configuration file and bootstrap
script which will configure the following stack for
VirtualBox.

* Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit
* 512MB RAM
* Port 8080 forwards to 80 on the guest
* Apache 2
	* This expects your project to have a folder named **www**. Apache will be pointed to that
